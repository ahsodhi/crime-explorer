# Crime Explorer

Crime Explorer is a flexible, adaptive program used to navigate and generate visual data from Statistics Canadaâ€™s downloadable CSV file.  
  
You can search for all statistics regarding a particualar crime in one or more locations, and you can also track a particular statistic of a crime over multiple years.  
  
The program allows you to generate an appropriate visual representation (bar graph or line plot) each time you execute a new query.
